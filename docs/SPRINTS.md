# HeapScope Sprints

Phases: **0.x** architecture, framework and skeleton; **1.x** quick wins; **2.x** heavy hitters; **3.x** depth to
match dotMemory (planned 2026-10-28); **Phase 4 candidates** what Phase 3 leaves out; the Backlog ([BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)) everything else. Closed sprints are
in [sprints/](sprints/): [Phase 0](sprints/phase-0.md), [Phase 1](sprints/phase-1.md),
[Phase 2](sprints/phase-2.md), [Phase 3, the peer review sprints, 3.9 and 3.10](sprints/phase-3.md).

## Sprint 3.9: Packaging and distribution

Closed 2026-11-01; its section is in [sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md) and its review in
[reviews/sprint-3.9.md](reviews/sprint-3.9.md). ADR-039 records the distribution decisions.

---

## Sprint 3.10: Visual design and README

Closed 2026-11-05; its section is in [sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md) and its review in
[reviews/sprint-3.10.md](reviews/sprint-3.10.md). ADR-040 records the visual design.

---

## Sprint 3.11: Screens that explain themselves

Closed 2026-11-10; its section is in [sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md) and its review in
[reviews/sprint-3.11.md](reviews/sprint-3.11.md). ADR-040 records the info icons, and ADR-032 the match of pinned objects.

## Sprint 3.12: First-show performance and refactor analysis

**Goal**: know why pages hitch the first time they open, and what in the code is worth refactoring, before Phase 4 adds to both.

**Background**: the product owner asked for this on 2026-11-05, from the 3.10 review. M16: cold first shows over 100 ms went from 3 to 7 per
run to 5 to 13, exempt from the gate, with the worst dispatcher lag 184 of 200 ms and the cause only inferred.

**Scope, to settle at /start-sprint**:
- Trace a cold first show (`--smoke-trace`, with JIT events), attribute the blips, and fix what the trace supports. Consider a ceiling
  on logged first shows, and a run on a Medium dump, not only the demo dumps.
- A refactor analysis of the codebase: what to change, why and at what cost, as a ranked list the owner decides on. It proposes; any
  refactor it leads to is the owner's call. It includes `PlatformHints` (3.10 review M36).
- To consider pulling in: the Backlog's slower first load (the object pass), and the tests that fail only under full load.
- The older cache fallback, moved from 3.10 by the product owner (2026-11-05; 3.10 review M14, M29 to M31, M37). After a loader update,
  a dump whose DAC is gone or not trusted cannot rebuild its cache, so it does not open. Open the older cache instead, with a note. It must
  cover every way a rebuild can lack the DAC (a symbol server failure, an untrusted DAC after a "no"), set the oldest loader version it accepts,
  free the first read's memory before the second, and say which views are refused without a DAC. Its first version caused most of the
  findings on 3.10's Moderate fixes, so review it as a feature.

**Tasks**: to be filled by /start-sprint.

## Peer review sprints

3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 worked through `docs/reviews/peer-review-3.5.md`; all closed ([sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md)).

## Phase 4 candidates

Not planned; picked from when Phase 3 closes (product owner, 2026-10-28: what Phase 3 does not address).
- A profiler-style live session: allocation data streamed beside the timeline, and snapshots faster than a full dump.
- What was allocated between two snapshots in Compare, from a trace recorded between them (from 2.5; needs traces in
  `session.json` on the snapshots' clock, and each tick's type id and module to join a diff's rows, ADR-028).
- A sunburst view beside the icicle chart for dominators and call trees.
- Analysis tabs: several analyses of a snapshot side by side, each with its own path (from 2.7; the branching analysis
  path covers coming back to an earlier analysis for now).
- Capture on Linux and macOS (from 2.3.5, ADR-025): process discovery through `/proc` and the diagnostics client, full
  dumps through the runtime's createdump (the diagnostics client's `WriteDump`), gcdumps through the vendored code;
  elevation and ptrace rules per system. Until then capture refuses there and points to `dotnet-dump`.
- WPF leak detectors with a WPF fixture app (from 2.6): binding to a non-INotifyPropertyChanged source, collection
  bindings, dependency property descriptors, x:Name.
