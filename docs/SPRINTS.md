# HeapScope Sprints

Phases: **0.x** architecture, framework and skeleton; **1.x** quick wins; **2.x** heavy hitters; **3.x** depth to
match dotMemory (planned 2026-10-28); **Phase 4 candidates** what Phase 3 leaves out; the Backlog ([BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)) everything else. Closed sprints are
in [sprints/](sprints/): [Phase 0](sprints/phase-0.md), [Phase 1](sprints/phase-1.md),
[Phase 2](sprints/phase-2.md), [Phase 3, the peer review sprints and 3.9](sprints/phase-3.md).

## Sprint 3.9: Packaging and distribution

Closed 2026-11-01; its section is in [sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md) and its review in
[reviews/sprint-3.9.md](reviews/sprint-3.9.md). ADR-039 records the distribution decisions.

---

## Peer review sprints

3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 worked through `docs/reviews/peer-review-3.5.md`; all closed ([sprints/phase-3.md](sprints/phase-3.md)).

---

## Phase 4 candidates

Not planned; picked from when Phase 3 closes (product owner, 2026-10-28: what Phase 3 does not address).
- A profiler-style live session: allocation data streamed beside the timeline, and snapshots faster than a full dump.
- What was allocated between two snapshots in Compare, from a trace recorded between them (from 2.5; needs traces in
  `session.json` on the snapshots' clock, and each tick's type id and module to join a diff's rows, ADR-028).
- A sunburst view beside the icicle chart for dominators and call trees.
- Analysis tabs: several analyses of a snapshot side by side, each with its own path (from 2.7; the branching analysis
  path covers coming back to an earlier analysis for now).
- Capture on Linux and macOS (from 2.3.5, ADR-025): process discovery through `/proc` and the diagnostics client, full
  dumps through the runtime's createdump (the diagnostics client's `WriteDump`), gcdumps through the vendored code;
  elevation and ptrace rules per system. Until then capture refuses there and points to `dotnet-dump`.
- WPF leak detectors with a WPF fixture app (from 2.6): binding to a non-INotifyPropertyChanged source, collection
  bindings, dependency property descriptors, x:Name.
